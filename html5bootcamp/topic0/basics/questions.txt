HTML VALIDATION:

- What happens when a browser parses invalid HTML?
When a browser parses invalid HTML it will render it anyway and it will interpret code as they are able to.

- What is the problem with this?
The main problem with this is that each browser will render our pages differently.

- Will using a frameset in a document validated against the HTML 4 Strict doctype generate an error?


THE HTML HEAD

- Why does it make sense to add a description in a meta element if it doesn’t get displayed on the screen?
The description will be displayed as the text below the link in search engine results

- What is the benefit of adding JavaScript to the head of a document and not in the body?
The benefit is that you make sure that your JavaScript is available before the main document loads

- How can you benefit from your browser’s caching and what do you need to do to make it work for you?
the next time you access the site, the files will be on your computer already, meaning they don't need to be downloaded again

- As search engines give the title of a document much love, wouldn’t it be useful to cram it full of relevant keywords? What are the downsides of this practice?


- As the title display can be a bit boring, wouldn’t it make sense to bold some words with a b element? Is that possible?
It makes sence but's not possible, yet.
