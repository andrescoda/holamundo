A very simple example of Angular data binding and interpolation. 

Note how the _ng-model_ attribute is shown in the _<h1>_ tag. The _name_ attribute 
is said to be _data bound_ to the view thru the _{{name}} expression_. 

AngularJS uses _interpolation_ to render the characters typed in the input box.
